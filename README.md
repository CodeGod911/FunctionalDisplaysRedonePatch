# FunctionalDisplaysRedonePatch
This mod simply fixes the item display cases by allowing over 25 items and fixing the stack problem by intelligently calculating the count of how many items of a type are to displayed : 1-9 1 Slot, 10-99 2 Slots, 100-999 3 Slots and so on. Weapon Racks are fixed too and are now able to retain mods and legendary.
