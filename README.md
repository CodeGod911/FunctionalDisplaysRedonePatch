# Functional Displays Redone (Patch)
This mod simply fixes the item display cases by allowing over 25 items and fixing the stack problem by intelligently calculating the count of how many items of a type are to displayed : 1-9 1 Slot, 10-99 2 Slots, 100-999 3 Slots and so on. Weapon Racks are fixed too and are now able to retain mods and legendary.
